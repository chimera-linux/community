# Community Guidelines

Chimera Linux is a free software project as well as a community. This document
is intended to provide a set of guidelines for all members of the community,
whether they are old or new, and whether they are contributors or just users
or observers.

## Team

The following people have global administrator rights:

* q66 <q66@chimera-linux.org>

The following people have commit access rights in one or more parts of the
project:

* Currently none

The following people have community moderator access:

* Currently none

Contributors into different repositories who do not have commit access can
be found in the individual repositories.

## Conduct

Chimera is informally organized. In places where that makes sense, notably
the realtime chat channels, there is no emphasis on keeping things on-topic.
A fun and casual environment is better than a boring one, and most topics
are okay. After all, a lot of people do not participate in FOSS strictly
for the technical efforts, but also to have a comfortable community space
where they can interact with like-minded people.

This should not be interpreted as a permission to behave in a toxic manner.
It is not just you - in order to get along, it is extremely important to be
respectful of other people and keep standards high.

If a conflict happens, or if you have any kind of concern, don't be afraid to
raise it - things cannot be fixed if nobody knows anything is wrong, and
bottled up conflicts are bad for the community as a whole. If you for some
reason cannot do that in public, contacting anybody with moderator rights
in private is alright too.

Notably, unwarranted personal attacks or any kind of harassment for any reason
are not tolerated. Additionally, participants are fully expected to observe the
same level of standards both in and outside of the project spaces, and not only
when representing the project. Harmful views that negatively affect any (and
particularly those that are marginalized in some way) group of people (this
does not include those intentionally causing harm themselves) are not welcome
in the project, and keeping good conduct within the project alone is simply
not enough.

Overtly malicious behavior is usually clear, but in other cases there may be
some doubt. When that happens, it is usually better to assume good intentions
by default, especially in a project that has members all over the world and
language barrier may create ambiguous situations. Clearing things up before
an intervention is necessary is always better than unnecessary conflict.

All violations will be handled based on their severity by anybody in power who
is available, and may range from a warning to an expulsion. If you feel you
have been wronged, you can appeal to anybody with global access rights, and
your case will be re-evaluated.

## Contributing

Running a distribution is a lot of work, and it is entirely reliant on the
work of the community. This is not just technical work such as packaging;
improving the documentation or even just helping other users with their
questions or participating in the community and making it better are all
worthwhile contributions.

If you want to contribute technical work, you should pick the part of the
distro you want to contribute into (each has a repository) and then read
the specific guidelines for each.

The primary place of technical work in Chimera is on GitHub.

* Organization: https://github.com/chimera-linux
* Packaging: https://github.com/chimera-linux/cports
* Website: https://github.com/chimera-linux/chimera-linux.github.io

We do not, and will not, ask you to sign any kind of CLA in any part of the
project. Provided a contribution is of sufficient quality and has appropriate
licensing, it will be accepted. If you are not sure if your contribution is
good enough, please raise it anyway. The worst case is no worse than if it
was not raised at all, and review can help get things into shape.

These are not the only repositories where work is being done. Various
supporting projects (typically things packaged in the distro) are present
within the organization. They are either things we have developed, or third
party projects we contribute into.

## Chat Channels

Our primary means of communication in the community is IRC. The primary
and currently the only IRC channel is `#chimera-linux` on the OFTC network.

You can find OFTC at https://oftc.net. You can use any IRC client compatible
with the network, as well as their web chat. It is highly encouraged to idle
in the channel (by e.g. using a bouncer), rather than connecting and leaving,
especially if you have questions. This is because people do not always monitor
their chats and it might take a while to get answers.

The secondary channel is on Matrix at `#chimera-linux:matrix.org`. The IRC
and Matrix channels are linked, so you can use whichever you prefer. Messages
are relayed transparently between both.

Because of this, we ask Matrix users not to use any advanced features only
available to Matrix, such as message editing. This is because such features
may not translate well to IRC and may clutter the channel.

Neither channel is currently publicly logged. However, people may be keeping
their own logs, so you should assume that it is.

## Other Spaces

Online spaces not covered in this document are fully unofficial and do not
represent the project in any way. Creation of such spaces is discouraged,
as it results in unnecessary sub-communities and makes the project harder
to approach. Please consider using one of the official channels instead.

If you feel like the creation of a new space is necessary, please discuss
it first. Chances are it can be made official, should there be any need
for it.
